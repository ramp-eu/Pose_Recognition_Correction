# Frontend to Pose Recognition #

Please run the frontend with
```
docker-compose up
```

When visiting `localhost:3000` in your browser, you will see an interface.
This interface reads its values from the Orion Broker, so when you see changing values everything works as expected.

This project was bootstrapped with [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
